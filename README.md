# Overview of the school district analysis:  

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once we replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like us to repeat the school district analysis that we did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
The purpose of this project analysis to help Maria analyzing data on student funding and students’ standardized tests scores. Our task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities.
